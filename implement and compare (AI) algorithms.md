# Guide to Writing an AI Dissertation on Designing and Comparing Algorithms

Writing a dissertation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be challenging, especially if your project involves developing a new algorithm or comparing multiple algorithms. This guide is designed for undergraduate AI students embarking on their first dissertation. It follows a typical thesis structure (modelled after *Exploiting Reward Machines with Deep Reinforcement* by Sun, 2023) and explains **why each chapter is needed**, **what content to include**, and **tips for clear writing**. Example excerpts from the sample dissertation are provided to illustrate good practices.

## Introduction

**Why this chapter matters:** The Introduction sets the stage for your entire dissertation. It engages the reader with the context and significance of your AI topic, clearly states the problem or research question, and outlines what you aim to achieve. A strong introduction explains **why** your research is important (e.g. a gap in existing algorithmic approaches) and gives an overview of **how** you will address it. It should motivate the rest of the dissertation.

**What to include:**

* **Background context:** Briefly describe the broader area of AI your work falls under. For example, if your dissertation is about reinforcement learning, mention its real-world applications or challenges to grab interest.
* **Problem statement and gap:** Clearly identify the specific problem or knowledge gap your work tackles. Explain what is lacking in current algorithms or why comparing certain algorithms is necessary. This shows the reader the **need** for your research. For instance, Sun (2023) notes that only two older algorithms had been combined with reward machines, and newer algorithms might perform better.
* **Research aim and objectives:** State what your dissertation will accomplish. This can be a general aim followed by specific objectives or questions. If you are designing a new algorithm, say so and outline its goal; if comparing algorithms, specify which and what aspects (performance, accuracy, etc.) you will compare. It often helps to enumerate objectives for clarity. For example, the introduction of the sample dissertation explicitly lists two main objectives of the research.
* **Approach overview:** Give a high-level summary of how you will achieve the objectives. Mention the methodology or the idea of the solution (without going into deep technical detail, which comes later). This might include naming the techniques or algorithms you'll develop or evaluate.
* **Significance:** Briefly explain why your solution or comparison matters. What advancement does it bring to the field of AI or to practical applications? This is your chance to convince the reader that the dissertation is valuable.
* **Thesis outline:** It is common to end the introduction with a few sentences outlining the structure of the dissertation (what each upcoming chapter contains). This roadmap helps readers know what to expect. For example, you might write, “The rest of this dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter 2 covers background concepts... Chapter 3 reviews related work...,” and so on, mirroring the approach in the sample dissertation.

**Tips for writing the Introduction:**

* **Start broad, then focus:** Begin with a general context or motivation (e.g. the rise of AI in a certain domain or a known challenge), then narrow down to your specific problem. This funnel approach provides clarity and relevance. Avoid starting in extreme detail or with jargon that might overwhelm readers.
* **Clearly state the problem and gap:** Ensure that by the end of your opening paragraphs, the reader understands *what* problem you are addressing and *why* it needs to be solved. Don’t assume the importance is obvious – spell it out. A common mistake is to be too vague about the research question or to imply a problem without explicitly stating it.
* **Define objectives and contributions:** Write your research objectives as clear, tangible statements (possibly as a bulleted list). If your work yields specific contributions (e.g. a new algorithm, a comparative analysis, a framework), consider summarising them in the introduction. This sets reader expectations. In our example, the author immediately explains that the thesis will adapt newer deep RL algorithms with reward machines and define benchmark tasks to evaluate them.
* **Keep it concise but informative:** Aim for a balance – the introduction should be substantial enough to cover the points above, but not so long that it drifts into results or detailed literature review. Avoid including technical minutiae or data – save those for later chapters.
* **Maintain coherence:** Ensure every part of the introduction flows logically. Each paragraph should follow from the previous: context → problem → objectives → approach → outline. This coherence makes your argument persuasive.
* **Engage the reader:** Use clear, accessible language. You can hint at the exciting implications of your work or a compelling example to spark interest. However, maintain an academic tone (avoid hype or grandiose claims unsupported by the work).

## Background

**Why this chapter is needed:** The Background chapter provides the foundational knowledge and theory the reader must understand before diving into your research. In AI projects, especially those proposing or comparing algorithms, readers may need an explanation of key concepts, mathematical formalisms, or technical terms. A well-written background ensures that your dissertation is self-contained: it **bridges the gap** between general AI knowledge and the specific context of your research. Essentially, it prepares and educates the reader so that later chapters (e.g. on your methods or experiments) are clear and meaningful.

**What to include:**

* **Core concepts and definitions:** Identify the fundamental concepts underlying your research. For example, if your dissertation is on deep reinforcement learning, you might explain what reinforcement learning entails, the notion of reward functions, or key terms like "partial observability". Only include concepts that are directly relevant to understanding your work. In the sample dissertation, Chapter 2 covers essential reinforcement learning concepts (e.g. discrete vs. continuous action domains, actor-critic architecture, etc.) because these are needed to follow the subsequent algorithm discussions. Define specialist terminology and acronyms on first use.
* **Theoretical foundations:** Provide any necessary mathematical or algorithmic background. This could include equations, pseudo-code of standard algorithms, or figures illustrating how an algorithm works. For instance, if you built on Q-learning or neural network architectures, describe those basics here. Keep the depth appropriate for an undergraduate level – rigorous but not overwhelming.
* **Relevant models or frameworks:** If your work builds on a known model or framework (e.g. Markov decision processes, neural network layers, specific datasets), describe those elements. In our example, the author might explain what a *Reward Machine* is and how it fits into reinforcement learning, as this concept is crucial for the whole thesis. Similarly, common algorithms like DDPG, SAC, etc., could be briefly introduced (though detailed related work comes later, a short introduction in background may help).
* **Scope of background:** Clarify the scope by focusing on topics that will later be referenced. You do not need to write a mini-textbook on all of AI – stick to areas that directly inform your research. A well-chosen background topic highlights fundamental knowledge **the reader must grasp to appreciate your methods and results**. The sample dissertation explicitly states that the background chapter **“highlights the fundamental concepts of the RL algorithms used in the thesis to help the reader better understand the theory behind all the algorithms.”** This guidance kept the background focused.
* **Examples to illustrate concepts:** Consider including simple examples or diagrams to clarify abstract ideas. For instance, if discussing continuous vs. discrete actions, an example of each (like controlling a robot arm with continuous torque vs. a game with discrete moves) can help cement the concept for the reader. Visuals or brief illustrative scenarios can make the background more engaging and understandable. Ensure any figures are well-labeled and referenced in the text.

**Tips for writing the Background:**

* **Teach, don’t just list:** Write the background as if you are teaching the reader. Explain concepts clearly in your own words rather than copying definitions. A common mistake is to dump a series of definitions or equations without explanation of how they connect to your research. Strive to show why each concept is relevant. For example, if you introduce "continuous action domains", immediately relate it to why it matters for the algorithms you will discuss.
* **Organize logically:** Structure this chapter in a sensible order. You might go from general to specific (broad AI concepts down to particular algorithms) or follow a thematic order (group related ideas together). Use subheadings to break the chapter into sections (as the sample thesis does, e.g., 2.1 Discrete and Continuous Action Domains, 2.7 Actor-Critic Architecture, etc.). This improves readability and allows readers to find information quickly.
* **Cite sources for theory:** Even though background information is often textbook knowledge, you should cite authoritative sources (textbooks, survey papers, or original research) for key ideas or definitions. This adds credibility and situates your work academically. For instance, if you mention the definition of a Markov Decision Process, cite a well-known RL textbook or paper.
* **Relevance is key:** Include only what you truly need. It’s tempting to write at length about the entire field, but extraneous material can confuse or bore the reader. Each subsection of your background should have a clear connection to your research aims. If you find a section that doesn’t feed into your later analysis or methodology, consider trimming it.
* **Keep it accessible:** Use straightforward language and examples since your audience may not be specialists in that sub-area. An undergraduate dissertation should be understandable to other computing students or academics who are not experts in your exact topic. Avoid overly dense or formal language when a simpler explanation will do. However, do use correct technical terms once defined, to maintain precision.
* **Avoid mixing results or opinions:** The background is not the place to present your novel ideas or results – save those for later. Steer clear of phrases like "we will show in Chapter 5 that..." or any evaluation of methods; the background should be factual and established knowledge. This separation makes your dissertation more coherent.

## Related Work (Literature Review)

**Why this chapter is needed:** The Related Work (or Literature Review) chapter demonstrates your understanding of existing research in your area and positions your work within the academic context. For a dissertation focused on algorithms, this section is critical: it reviews what algorithms or approaches others have already developed, how they perform, and where gaps or open problems remain. By critically examining past work, you justify your own research: perhaps no one has tried the new algorithm you propose, or there is disagreement on which known algorithm is best for a certain task – hence your comparative study is needed. In short, this chapter **shows that you are building on a foundation of knowledge and highlights how your work is distinct**. It also prevents duplication of effort by acknowledging others’ contributions.

**What to include:**

* **Overview of existing solutions:** Summarize the current state of the art relevant to your dissertation. If you are designing a new algorithm, describe the most important algorithms currently used for similar problems (including their strengths and weaknesses). If you are comparing algorithms, introduce each algorithm you will compare and any known results about them. The sample dissertation’s Related Work chapter, for example, is organized to cover each major algorithm that the thesis builds upon or compares: it includes sections on Reward Machines (and specific variants like CRM and HRL), DDPG, SAC, TD3, PPO, etc.. This ensured all necessary related algorithms were explained.
* **Key papers and developments:** Identify major research works (papers, articles) for each area or algorithm. Provide a concise review of what each work did. Focus on findings that are relevant to your thesis question. For instance, if algorithm A was shown to excel in a certain environment but fail in another, note that – it might relate to why you think algorithm B could be better, or why a new approach is needed. Each subsection or topic you cover should tie back to your research motivation.
* **Comparative analysis:** Don’t just describe prior works — compare and critique them. Point out trends or conflicting results in the literature. What do these algorithms have in common? How do they differ in approach or performance? Highlight any limitations or open questions left by existing research. This critical analysis sets up the rationale for *your* work. For example, you might note that although Algorithm X is fast, it’s unstable, whereas Algorithm Y is stable but slow – so perhaps a new method can combine their advantages. The related work section is a place to subtly emphasize the **gap or problem** your dissertation addresses (e.g., “Method Z has not been applied to scenario Y yet,” or “no study has compared X and Y under the same conditions”).
* **Organization by theme:** Structure the literature review in a sensible way. Common approaches are by *topic* (group similar approaches together), by *chronology* (from older to newer developments), or by *method category*. The sample thesis groups related work by algorithmic families and concepts – starting with the specific framework (Reward Machines and enhancements like CRM, HRL), then covering each deep RL algorithm and how it has been or could be combined with reward machines. Use subheadings (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, etc.) for each theme or algorithm so readers can easily navigate the section.
* **Relevance to your work:** For each piece of related work you mention, make it clear how it relates to your dissertation. For example: “Smith et al. (2021) introduced Algorithm X for this problem, but it assumes full observability, which our approach relaxes,” or “We build on the work of Jones (2022) by adopting their network architecture as a baseline.” Even if you save detailed comparisons for the Discussion or Conclusion, the literature review should already set the stage by foreshadowing how your approach differs or why your comparison is insightful.
* **Summary of gap:** Conclude the related work chapter with a brief summary of what’s lacking in the literature. For instance, after reviewing everything, you might say, “In summary, while several algorithms exist for this task, no prior work has systematically compared their performance on X,” or “it remains unclear how newer algorithms might perform when integrated with concept Y – a gap this dissertation aims to fill.” This concluding part solidifies the justification for your study.

**Tips for writing the Related Work:**

* **Be critical and analytical:** A literature review is not an annotated bibliography; avoid simply listing studies one after the other. Instead, synthesize information. Discuss how studies relate to each other (do they agree, contradict, build on one another?). Also, identify limitations or assumptions in existing work. For example, “Many existing approaches \[A, B, C] assume noise-free data, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios.” This critical tone shows you understand the field deeply.
* **Use a consistent structure for discussing studies:** If you are comparing multiple algorithms or papers, it might help to discuss each using a similar structure (e.g., for each algorithm: describe how it works, then its pros/cons, then results from literature). This consistency makes it easier for readers to follow and compare the descriptions. The sample thesis, for instance, dedicates separate subsections to each algorithm and even to specific improvements (like TD3’s improvements over DDPG). Each subsection provides details that will later be useful when interpreting experimental results.
* **Cite thoroughly and correctly:** Give credit to all sources of ideas, algorithms, and data that you mention. Use the appropriate citation style consistently. If two or three key papers introduced a concept, cite them together. If you are discussing a specific result or figure from a paper, make sure to cite that source. Proper citation not only avoids plagiarism but also lets interested readers find more details in those works.
* **Stay relevant and up-to-date:** Include the most relevant and recent research. In a fast-moving field like AI, readers will expect you to cite up-to-date papers (especially if new algorithms have emerged in the last couple of years that relate to your problem). However, don’t include irrelevant side-topics. If your dissertation is on deep learning for game playing, a lengthy review of general machine learning history isn’t needed – stick to game-playing AI and perhaps reinforcement learning advances.
* **Connect to your research:**
  Throughout the section, subtly link back to your own work. Use phrases like “however, no existing method addresses …, which is the focus of this dissertation” or “this insight will be utilized in our proposed algorithm in Chapter 4.” This reminds the reader why the literature review matters. For example, after reviewing DDPG, SAC, and others, Sun (2023) identified that newer algorithms have outperformed DDPG, suggesting the value in combining reward machines with those newer algorithms (setting up the basis for the methodology).
* **Avoid common pitfalls:** Do not make the related work chapter an unstructured “data dump” of everything you read. Each paragraph should have a clear point. Also, avoid overly strong language when critiquing others (“their method is bad”); instead, use measured academic tone (“their method is computationally heavy, which may limit real-time use”). Another mistake is writing a perfect review but failing to highlight *how it leads to your own research* – always circle back to the niche your work fills.

## Methodology / Proposed Approach

**Why this chapter is needed:** This chapter is the core of your dissertation – it details **what you did or created** to address the research problem. If you are designing a new algorithm, this is where you **explain your algorithm** in depth. If you are comparing algorithms, this is where you describe **your experimental approach or criteria** for comparison. Essentially, the methodology chapter convinces the reader that your approach is sound and reproducible. It should provide enough detail that another researcher could, in theory, implement your algorithm or replicate your comparison study. This chapter translates the ideas from the introduction into a concrete solution or experimental plan.

**What to include (for an algorithm-design project):**

* **Rationale for your approach:** Begin by reminding the reader of the problem and the overall idea of your solution. Explain the reasoning behind designing this algorithm or system. For example, “To improve learning efficiency in partially observable environments, we propose combining reward machines with state-of-the-art off-policy algorithms.” The sample dissertation’s Chapter 4 starts by noting that prior reward-machine algorithms (DDPG, HRL) were outperformed by newer algorithms, which justifies introducing three new RM-based algorithms using SAC, TD3, and PPO. Providing this context at the start helps the reader understand *why* your method is needed.
* **Design and formulation of the algorithm:** Describe the new algorithm in a structured way. This may include: the overall architecture or pipeline, mathematical formulations (e.g. objective functions, pseudocode), and key components or steps. Present the algorithm’s logic clearly: if it’s an extension of an existing algorithm, highlight what is the same and what is modified. For instance, Sun (2023) introduces “SAC-CRM” by first stating it uses SAC as a baseline and then explaining the changes (adding the reward machine’s counterfactual experiences). Such clarity — stating what is retained from the baseline and what is novel — is very effective. If helpful, break this section into subsections for each major part of the algorithm or for each new algorithm variant (e.g., 4.1 Algorithm A, 4.2 Algorithm B).
* **Diagrams or pseudocode:** Often, complex algorithms are best explained with visuals or pseudocode. Consider including a figure showing the flowchart of your algorithm or a step-by-step pseudocode listing. Label these clearly (e.g., “Algorithm 1” or “Figure 2”) and reference them in the text (e.g., “as shown in Algorithm 1”). In the sample thesis, the author includes pseudocode listings (Algorithms 7, etc.) to illustrate how the agent’s learning process is modified. Make sure to describe in words what the pseudocode does, so the reader can understand the logic without reading code line-by-line.
* **Technical details:** Provide necessary details about how the algorithm is implemented or any parameters and settings. This could include model architectures (if using neural networks), hyperparameters, or specific libraries used, but focus on the aspects critical to the algorithm’s functioning. For example, if your new algorithm involves a novel loss function or a unique reward shaping method, describe those components formally. If certain standard techniques are used (like Adam optimizer, a replay buffer, etc.), you can mention them without deep re-explanation (assuming they were covered in background or are common knowledge) – but do note anything non-standard.
* **Assumptions and constraints:** Be explicit about any assumptions you make (e.g., assuming a certain type of input data or environment setup) and the scope of your method (what it is designed for and potential limitations). This transparency will be valuable later when discussing results. For instance, if your algorithm assumes fully observable states, state that now.
* **If comparing algorithms (instead of designing one):** Your methodology might involve describing the experiment design rather than a new algorithm. In that case, include: the criteria of comparison (e.g., accuracy, training time, memory usage), the selected algorithms (with brief info on each if not already covered in related work), the dataset or simulation environment used for testing them, and how you will evaluate them (e.g., metrics, statistical tests). Essentially, you are laying out an experimental plan so that the reader knows exactly how you will answer the comparison question.

**Tips for writing the Methodology:**

* **Be clear and systematic:** Present your method in a logical order. A good approach is often top-down: start with an overview of the approach, then delve into details of each component. Use paragraphs or sub-sections for different parts of the algorithm or experiment. Transitions like “First, … Next, … Finally, …” help guide the reader. Listing steps (even in bullet or numbered form) can be useful if the procedure is sequential.
* **Justify design choices:** Don’t just state *what* you did—explain *why* you did it that way. For example, if you chose three particular algorithms to compare, explain why those three (perhaps they are most popular or represent different strategies). If you introduce a new parameter or heuristic in your algorithm, explain its intuition. The reader should see that your approach is thoughtfully designed, not arbitrary. In the sample, the author chose SAC, TD3, and PPO as baselines **because** those were mainstream algorithms expected to outperform the older DDPG. By providing reasoning, you also demonstrate critical thinking.
* **Use diagrams and tables for clarity:** If your method can be summarized in a diagram or you have a system architecture, include it. Visual aids can often convey the workflow or components of an algorithm more clearly than text. Ensure every figure/table is introduced in the text and its content explained. For example, if you have a table of algorithm parameters, mention a few key entries in the text.
* **Maintain consistency:** Use consistent terminology and notation throughout the chapter (and the whole thesis). If you defined a symbol or term in the background, use the same here. For instance, if you use \$Q\$ for a Q-value, keep using \$Q\$ and don’t switch to \$V\$ or something unexpectedly. Consistency helps readability and avoids confusion.
* **Anticipate reader questions:** Put yourself in the reader’s shoes – after each major description, ask “Would the reader understand how to do this, or would they have questions?” Make sure you address likely questions. For example, if you mention a "training epoch", specify how many or how you decided on that number. If you present pseudocode, consider if someone would need clarification on any step and provide it in the text.
* **Avoid overly informal tone:** While explaining your method, keep the writing formal and precise. Avoid phrases like “then we just tweak the network a bit”. Instead, describe exactly what was done (“we fine-tuned the network by adjusting the learning rate to 0.001 after 50 epochs”). Clarity and precision are key aspects of methodology writing.
* **Common mistakes:** One mistake to avoid is leaving gaps in the description (assuming the reader "just knows" something). It’s safer to err on the side of providing a bit too much detail than too little. Another mistake is mixing results or discussion into the method – save interpretation for later. For instance, do not include statements like “this algorithm performed better than the baseline” in the methodology; that belongs in the evaluation chapter. Stick to describing the method and *predicting* why it should work, not *proving* it works (that’s for results). Finally, ensure not to plagiarize any part of existing algorithms – if you quote or paraphrase an algorithm from a source, cite it. But ideally, describe things in your own words for originality.

## Experimental Evaluation (Results and Analysis)

**Why this chapter is needed:** After proposing a new algorithm or hypothesizing about algorithm performance, you must provide evidence to back up your claims. The Experimental Evaluation (often split into “Results” and “Discussion” sections) is where you **test your algorithm or compare algorithms** and analyze the outcomes. This chapter demonstrates the validity of your approach and provides insight into its behavior. For a comparative study, it definitively answers which algorithm performs better under which conditions. Essentially, this section is the **proof of the pudding** – it shows what happened when theory was put into practice and interprets what those results mean. Without this, a dissertation would be purely speculative.

**What to include:**

* **Experiment setup:** Start by describing how you set up your experiments. Detail the **environment, dataset, or tasks** you used. In AI algorithm research, this might mean describing simulation environments, benchmarks, or real-world data on which you tested the algorithms. Be specific: mention sizes of datasets, characteristics of environments, etc. The sample dissertation’s Chapter 5, for example, defines a total of eight tasks across two continuous-control domains (Half-Cheetah and Ant) to evaluate all algorithms. By covering multiple tasks of varying complexity, the author ensured a comprehensive evaluation. You should also explain **why** you chose these particular test scenarios – e.g. they simulate real-world challenges or they expose specific strengths/weaknesses of the algorithms.
* **Evaluation metrics:** Clarify what metrics or criteria you used to measure performance. Common metrics in AI could be accuracy, reward achieved, learning speed (convergence time), memory usage, etc., depending on the project. Define each metric if not obvious. For instance, “We measure cumulative reward over 1 million timesteps as the performance metric” or “Classification accuracy (%) on the test set is used to compare models.” If you perform statistical tests or calculate confidence intervals, mention that too.
* **Baseline and comparative methods:** List the algorithms or models you are comparing against. If you developed a new algorithm, you might compare it to existing ones (baselines) to show its merits. If your study is a pure comparison, those algorithms *are* essentially your baselines for each other. Ensure you’ve described these algorithms either here or earlier in related work. The reader should know exactly which methods are being evaluated. For clarity, sometimes a table of methods and their key characteristics can be helpful.
* **Experimental procedure:** Describe how the experiments were conducted. This includes any training procedures, parameter settings, number of trials (runs) for averaging results, hardware used (if important, e.g. GPU model), and duration. For example, “Each algorithm was trained for 1e6 timesteps on each task, and results were averaged over 5 independent runs to account for stochasticity.” Such details are important for reproducibility and to ensure a fair comparison. If you tuned hyperparameters for each algorithm, explain that process.
* **Results presentation:** Present the results clearly using figures and tables. This could include learning curves, bar charts, or tables of numerical results. Make sure every figure/table has a number and caption, and you refer to them in the text (e.g., “Figure 3 shows the learning curves for all algorithms on the Half-Cheetah tasks.”). In the text, highlight the key observations from each figure or table. For instance: *“As shown in Table 1, Algorithm A achieved higher accuracy than Algorithm B in all five datasets.”* or *“Figure 5 illustrates that our proposed method converges faster than the baseline.”* If results span many scenarios, consider summarizing: the sample thesis, for example, likely summarized that the new SAC-CRM algorithm outperformed others on most tasks.
* **Analysis of results:** After stating the results, delve into *why* you got those results. This is the discussion part where you interpret findings: explain the reasons or intuition behind the performance differences. For example, *“Algorithm X outperforms Algorithm Y on task Z because X’s design can handle the sparse rewards better, as discussed earlier.”* Similarly, if something unexpected occurred (say an algorithm you thought would do well didn’t), discuss possible reasons (perhaps it overfits, or a certain assumption was violated in that environment). This shows critical thinking and deep understanding. In the sample dissertation, the author not only reports that SAC-CRM performed best in most tasks, but also analyzes advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm on different types of tasks.
* **Comparative evaluation:** If comparing multiple algorithms, explicitly compare them in writing. Don’t leave it to the reader to interpret a graph. Say which algorithm was best and under what conditions. Also mention any trade-offs (e.g., one algorithm is fastest, another is most robust, etc.). If you have multiple metrics, discuss how they trade off.
* **Statistical significance (if applicable):** If you conducted statistical tests to verify differences (e.g., t-test, ANOVA), present those results (like p-values) to strengthen your claims that one method truly outperforms another and it’s not just random chance. For undergraduate projects this might not always be required, but it’s a good practice if feasible.
* **Examples or case studies:** Sometimes it’s helpful to include a specific example from the results to illustrate a point. For instance, you might describe a particular failure case or a scenario where one algorithm succeeds and another fails, to give the reader an intuitive understanding beyond the aggregate metrics. Ensure this doesn’t derail the focus, but a short narrative example can be powerful.
* **Summary of findings:** Conclude the evaluation chapter with a brief recap of the main findings. Emphasize which algorithm or approach was best, and whether the results met your expectations. This sets up the final conclusion chapter where these results will be put in context.

**Tips for writing the Experimental Evaluation:**

* **Be objective:** Report the results honestly, even if they are not what you hoped for. Avoid bias in describing outcomes. Use neutral language like “achieved”, “performed”, “outperformed” rather than value-laden terms like “amazing” or “disastrous”. If your new algorithm did not beat the baselines in some cases, acknowledge it and provide possible explanations. This honesty actually strengthens the validity of your work.
* **Use past tense for results:** Typically, write about your experiments and results in the past tense (since they have been done), e.g., “Algorithm A **achieved** an average reward of…” whereas general facts can be present tense (e.g., “Algorithm A **is** a model-free RL method.”). Maintaining proper tense helps clarity.
* **Don’t overcrowd with data:** Present data in a digestible way. If you have large tables, consider moving raw data to appendices or summarizing it. Figures should not be too small or cluttered – make sure labels and legends are readable. Each figure/table should illustrate a point; if it’s not adding new insight, consider if it’s needed. Quality of analysis is more important than quantity of graphs.
* **Guide the reader through figures:** When you introduce a figure or table, guide the reader on what to look at. For example, “From Figure 4, note that the blue curve (our algorithm) climbs sharply, reaching a higher reward than the red curve (baseline) by 100k steps.” This helps readers interpret the visual correctly and quickly.
* **Relate back to theory:** Connect results to the theory or expectations set earlier. If in your introduction you hypothesized your algorithm would handle partial observability better, and indeed it got higher rewards in a partially observable task, point that out and tie it back to your hypothesis. Conversely, if an expected outcome didn’t materialize, discuss potential reasons grounded in theory or prior literature. This reflective approach shows depth of understanding.
* **Address variability and reliability:** Especially in AI experiments, results can have variability. Mention if you averaged results over multiple runs and perhaps include error bars or standard deviations to show variability. If some results were inconsistent or had high variance, discuss that. It’s better to acknowledge uncertainty than to present results as 100% certain when they’re not.
* **Compare with related work:** If applicable, compare your results with those reported by others (from the literature review). For example, “Our implementation of DDPG achieved a reward of X, which is similar to the value reported by Smith et al. (2022) for the same task.” Or, if you proposed an algorithm, “Unlike the results in Jones (2021) where Algorithm Y failed on environment Z, our approach succeeds, likely due to…”. This shows how your work fits into or advances the existing knowledge.
* **Stay focused on answering the question:** It’s easy to get lost in detailing every observation. Keep in mind the main question: did your algorithm solve the problem or outperform others? Ensure that the discussion in this chapter clearly answers that. If comparing algorithms, the reader should come away knowing *which algorithm is best under which conditions*, and *why*. If presenting a new algorithm, the reader should learn how well it works and what its strengths/weaknesses are.

## Conclusion

**Why this chapter is needed:** The Conclusion is where you wrap up the entire dissertation, driving home the main messages. In this chapter, you **summarize the findings and contributions** of your work in a concise way, reflect on their implications, and often suggest future directions. A strong conclusion gives the reader a satisfying sense of closure – it answers the question “So, what did we learn, and why does it matter?” For an algorithm-focused project, the conclusion highlights how the new algorithm or comparative insights have advanced understanding, and what could be done next. This chapter is also important for demonstrating critical thinking: acknowledging limitations and proposing realistic future work shows academic maturity.

**What to include:**

* **Recap of research problem and approach:** Begin by briefly restating the problem your dissertation addressed and the approach you took. This reminds the reader of the context. One or two sentences are usually enough (e.g., “This dissertation set out to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by introducing reward machines to newer algorithms.”).
* **Summary of key findings:** Summarize the most important results or outcomes. Focus on big-picture conclusions rather than small details. For example: “We found that among all algorithms tested, SAC-CRM consistently achieved the highest rewards, confirming our hypothesis that integrating reward machines with off-policy methods boosts performance.” If multiple insights were gained (e.g., performance varied by task type), note those as well. The sample dissertation’s conclusion explicitly states its main findings – such as which new algorithm performed best and how different algorithms have their own advantages in different scenarios. This helps the reader recall the answers to the research questions.
* **Contributions of the work:** Clearly state what the original contributions of your dissertation are. This can overlap with the findings, but it's often framed as what *new knowledge or tools* you have provided. For instance, “The key contributions of this work are: (1) three novel algorithms (SAC-CRM, TD3-CRM, PPO-CRM) combining reward machines with deep RL, (2) a comprehensive evaluation across eight tasks demonstrating their performance, and (3) analysis of each algorithm’s strengths and weaknesses for different task types”. Enumerating contributions (either in prose or as a bulleted list) is a good practice, as it clearly communicates the value of your work to future readers.
* **Implications:** Discuss the significance of your findings for the field of AI. What do the results mean for researchers or practitioners? For example, if one algorithm proved best, does that suggest it should be used in real-world applications X? If two algorithms have trade-offs, what insight does that give into algorithm design? You might also mention if your work supports or contradicts any existing theories or expectations from the literature. This shows you are thinking about how your work fits into the broader scientific conversation.
* **Limitations:** Every study has limitations, and acknowledging them strengthens your conclusion. Be honest about what your work did not cover or where it might not apply. For instance: “This study was limited to simulated tasks with known reward functions; the algorithms’ performance in more complex real-world settings remains to be seen.” Mentioning limitations does not undermine your work – instead, it provides a realistic scope and can inspire future research.
* **Future work:** Often included as a subsection or part of the conclusion, future work suggestions indicate how the research could be expanded or improved. Think about unanswered questions or interesting avenues that emerged. For example, “Future work could explore tuning the hyperparameters of SAC-CRM for even greater stability, or investigating how these algorithms perform on tasks with image inputs instead of state vectors.” The sample thesis, for instance, suggests exploring more diverse environments and methods to stabilize the best-performing algorithm in further studies. Make sure your future work items are specific and relevant, not just generic statements. Ideally, they should flow logically from your results or limitations (e.g., “because we noticed X, a natural next step is to investigate Y”).
* **Closing statement:** End the conclusion (and the dissertation) with a strong final thought. This could be a broad statement about how your work contributes to the vision of AI, or a hopeful note about the potential impact of your findings. Keep it professional and avoid exaggeration. For example, a modest final line might be, “In summary, this dissertation advances the understanding of algorithm performance in reward-machine-based reinforcement learning and lays the groundwork for more efficient autonomous agents.” A good closing gives a sense of completion.

**Tips for writing the Conclusion:**

* **Keep it concise and focused:** The conclusion should be shorter than the main chapters. Avoid introducing new results or going into detailed analysis – that belongs in earlier sections. Aim to synthesize, not to repeat everything verbatim. One effective approach is to ensure each paragraph of the conclusion has a purpose (summary of work, key result, implications, future work), so the content doesn’t become redundant.
* **Echo the introduction (but with answers):** There is a symmetry between the introduction and conclusion. In the introduction, you posed questions or objectives; in the conclusion, you should explicitly state how those were addressed. If you listed objectives, you can structure part of the conclusion around them (“Objective 1 was to do X – in Chapter 4 we achieved this by…, Objective 2 was to… and our results in Chapter 5 showed…”). The sample dissertation’s conclusion section, for example, references each chapter to summarize contributions and outcomes. This gives a satisfying sense of completeness.
* **Use confident tone for results:** By the time you write the conclusion, you know what you found. Present your findings confidently using definitive language, but without overstating. For instance, “The experiments demonstrate that Algorithm A outperforms Algorithm B under conditions X and Y,” is stronger and clearer than, “We believe Algorithm A might be better than B.” However, remain honest – if something was inconclusive, it’s fine to say “The results for scenario Z were mixed, suggesting that further investigation is needed.”
* **Avoid new information:** Do not introduce new data, new analysis, or new terms in the conclusion. Everything here should refer to earlier parts of the thesis. If you realize there is a key piece of information not mentioned before, the proper fix is to add it to a previous chapter, not squeeze it into the conclusion.
* **No references (ideally):** By the conclusion, you typically aren’t citing other works; you are talking about *your* work. The conclusion should be in your own voice, reflecting on what you did. The exception might be if discussing real-world impact or very generally how it ties to broader trends, but usually the heavy citations belong in intro and related work.
* **Polish the prose:** Conclusions are often read by examiners to gauge understanding. Make sure it’s well-written, clear, and free of errors. It’s your final impression, so ensure it is positive. Reading it aloud to yourself can help catch any awkward phrasing or overly long sentences.
* **Future work optimism:** When suggesting future work, strike an optimistic yet realistic tone. Don’t make it sound like your project failed because so much is left to do; instead, frame future work as natural progression. For example, “Building on these promising results, future research could explore…” rather than “Due to time constraints, we didn’t do…”. Even if some aspects didn’t go as planned, focus on what *can* be explored subsequently.
* **Conclude effectively:** Your very last sentences should give a sense of finality. Avoid trailing off with minor points. Some writers like to end with a broad statement connecting back to the big picture (as mentioned). Others end with a concise statement of achievement. Choose an ending that feels right for the tone of your thesis – ideally something that underscores the contribution. The reader should close your dissertation thinking, “That was a solid piece of research that achieved what it set out to do.”

Using the guidance above, you should be able to structure and write each chapter of your AI dissertation with clarity and purpose. Remember that **clarity, coherence, and critical analysis** are crucial throughout the document. Each chapter has a distinct role, but they should all tell a cohesive story of your research: from motivation, through execution, to findings and implications. By following a clear structure (like the one modelled here) and heeding the writing tips, you will make it easier for readers (and examiners) to understand and appreciate your work. Good luck with your dissertation!
